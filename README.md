# Speech Sentiment Recognition

This project focuses on speech sentiment recognition using machine learning. The goal is to classify audio files into different speech sentiment categories based on extracted features. As the project progresses this README file will be updated.

## Modularity

As development continues I will be focusing on streamlining the model development based on the RAVDESS dataset on kaggle. However I will modularize my code wherever possible for later re-use on different datasets.
